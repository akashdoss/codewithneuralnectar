üìù Problem Statement: Find and Format Vowels in a String
Description:

Given a string S, find the number of vowels V in the string. Print the string across V lines based on the following conditions:

The first line encloses the 1st vowel and Vth vowel with hyphens -.
The second line encloses the 2nd vowel and (V-1)th vowel with hyphens -.
This pattern continues until all lines are printed.
Note:

If V is odd, the middle line contains the string with the middle vowel enclosed.
At least one vowel is always present in the string S.
Example:

Input:

Copy code
NOTEBOOKPAPER
Output:

mathematica
Copy code
N-O-TEBOOKPAP-E-R
NOT-E-BOOKP-A-PER
NOTEB-O--O-KPAPER
NOTEB-O--O-KPAPER
NOT-E-BOOKP-A-PER
N-O-TEBOOKPAP-E-R
üíª Solution
Here‚Äôs the Python solution to solve this problem:

python
Copy code
# üöÄ Input the string
S = input().strip()

# üîç Find the number of vowels in the string
V = len([ch for ch in S if ch in 'AEIOUaeiou'])

# üõ†Ô∏è Generate the formatted output for each line
for ctr in range(1, V + 1):
    resString = ""
    currVowel = 0
    
    for ch in S:
        if ch not in 'AEIOUaeiou':
            resString += ch
        else:
            currVowel += 1
            if currVowel == ctr or currVowel == V - ctr + 1:
                resString += "-" + ch + "-"
            else:
                resString += ch
    
    # üñ®Ô∏è Print each formatted line
    print(resString)
Explanation:

Input Handling: The code takes the input string S and calculates the number of vowels V.
Looping Through Lines: The code loops through each line, determining which vowels to enclose with hyphens based on their positions.
Constructing Each Line: The code constructs the output line by line, placing hyphens around the required vowels and then printing the result.
Output: The string is printed across multiple lines with specific vowels enclosed within hyphens.
