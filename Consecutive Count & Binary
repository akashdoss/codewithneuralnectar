The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must form an integer X by modifying the binary representation of N based on the following condition.
If Os are repeated consecutively (possibly once) in the binary representation of N, then the program must replace those Os with the number of times it is repeated consecutively.
Finally, the program must print the binary representation of X as the output.
Note: There are no more than 9 consecutive Os in the binary representation of N.
Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 10^5
Input Format: The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the binary representation of X.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 25
Output: 10101111010101


N=int(input())
binVal=bin(N)[2:]

        zeroCount=0
        resultNum+='1'
    else:
        zeroCount+=1
resultNum+=str(zeroCount)*zeroCount
