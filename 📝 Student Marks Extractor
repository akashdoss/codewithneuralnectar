📝 Student Marks Extractor
This Python script takes the names of students and their corresponding marks as input. The marks are enclosed within the first and last characters of the students' names. The script then outputs each student's name along with their extracted marks.

🎯 Problem Statement
Given a list of students and their marks where the marks are embedded in the first and last character of their names, the program should extract and print each student's name with their respective marks.

🛠️ How It Works
The script first splits the input names and marks into separate lists.
A dictionary is created to map the first and last character of the marks string to the actual marks.
Finally, the program iterates over each student's name and prints their marks by matching the corresponding first and last character.
📄 Example Input/Output
Input:
JAKE RAVI ABDUL AYSHA DIYA
A98L J76E A100A D88A R91I
Output:
JAKE 76
RAVI 91
ABDUL 98
AYSHA 100
DIYA 88

🚀 Code Implementation
python

# Accept the input of student names
student_names = input().split()

# Accept the input of student marks
student_marks = input().split()

# Create a dictionary to store the marks associated with the first and last character of each mark
marks_dict = {}
for mark in student_marks:
    # The key is the first and last character of the mark string
    key = mark[0] + mark[-1]
    # The value is the mark number between the first and last character
    marks_dict[key] = mark[1:-1]

# Iterate over each student name
for student in student_names:
    # The key for the student is the first and last character of their name
    key = student[0] + student[-1]
    # Retrieve the corresponding mark using the key
    print(student, marks_dict[key])
